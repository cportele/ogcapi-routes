== Terms and Definitions
This document used the terms defined in https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/directives/directives.php[OGC Policy Directive 49], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this standard and OGC documents do not use the equivalent phrases in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

This document also uses terms defined in the OGC Standard for Modular specifications (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3]), also known as the 'ModSpec'. The definitions of terms such as standard, specification, requirement, and conformance test are provided in the ModSpec.
