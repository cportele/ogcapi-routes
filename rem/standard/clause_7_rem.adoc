[[RouteExchangeModel]]
== Route Exchange Model

=== Overview

This document specifies a single encoding of the Route model described in the previous clause for the creation and transfer of route information between a variety of routing components ("Route Exchange Model"). The encoding uses https://geojson.org/[GeoJSON] to represent routes according to the model described above and is defined in the next clause. 

A GeoJSON feature collection is used to represent the Route. Each RouteComponent is represented by a GeoJSON feature in the feature collection of the route. 

GeoJSON is used for the following reasons:

* lightweight
* extensible
* widely supported in libraries and tools
* consistent with the emerging http://www.ogcapi.org/[OGC API standards]
* an https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946[open standard]

The Route Exchange Model supports three variants:

* Full: All route information is encoded in a GeoJSON feature collection. This is the default model and must be supported by all Routing API server-side and client-side components.
* Overview: A single GeoJSON feature detailing the route geometry along the network and the main properties of the route.
* Segments: The first segment of a route and a link to the second segment, if there is more than one segment in the route. Subsequent segments will contain a link to the previous and next segment. The final segment contains only a link to the previous segment. Each segment is a GeoJSON feature.

All implementations need to support the first variant (Full). The other two variants provide additional functionality to support a variety of use cases, specifically the Denied, Degraded, Intermittent and Low Bandwidth (DDIL) network use cases. Both options allow the user to retrieve the minimal information required for their use case. This could be the current step of the route, or an overview to assess the suggested route. In both cases only small GeoJSON objects are passed over the DDIL network. These variants also provide the option to conduct a comprehensive assessment of routes thereby allowing the user to request a number of route overviews in quick succession, choose the route which is most preferable and then reuse the route definition of the chosen route to request the full route.

The following sections in this clause below specifies the requirements classes that implementations need to conform to.

[[rc_rem]]
=== Requirements class "Route Exchange Model (core)"

This requirement class states requirements that apply to all
representations of a route.

The normative statements use the JSON Schema variant defined by
OpenAPI 3.0 to specify schema components.
